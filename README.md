# Go To Window

**Alpha** - [Download](https://github.com/christianrondeau/GoToWindow/releases)

No more need for alt-tabbing through dozens of windows, or looking for your windows in the task bar. Simply press `Alt` + `Tab`, type a few characters from the window title or process name you want to switch to and press enter. 

For the keyboard maniacs.

## Usage

Launch `GoToWindow.exe`. You can also place it in in the Windows Startup menu to launch it automatically with Windows.

* Press `Alt` + `Tab` to open the windows list. All windows are shown, with the most recently accessed first.

* Press `Enter` to go to the previously accessed window (same behavior as standard Windows `Alt` + `Tab`)

* Press the `Up` and `Down` arrows to navigate in the list, and press `Enter` to switch to the application.

* Start typing keywords to filter the list. Note that only windows that contain all words in either the window title _or_ the process name will be shown.

* If no opened window is found, press `Enter` to search directly in the Windows Search charm.

* Press `Alt` + `Number (1 - 9)` to directly open the application at the selected index from the list.

* Press `Escape` to close the window.

## Tips and gotchas

* To switch to an application that has elevated privileges (Run as Administrator), GoToWindow must also run with elevated privileges.
